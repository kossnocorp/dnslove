# DNS Love

ðŸš§ WIP

## Goal

DNS editors lack an excellent user experience because they are never the main product. Customers need to edit the records once in a blue moon and don't consider it a significant problem, so nobody bothers enough to fix it.

I, however, am addicted to buying domains and launching projects and had enough.

DNS Love is an advanced DNS editor focused on user experience. The project's goal is to make the DNS editing experience absurdly good.

Some ideas that I want to explore:

- [ ] Smart editor that allows to set up multiple records at once and considers the context, i.e. update the priority or reuses the same subdomain when adding a new record.

- [ ] Changes history with the diff and the ability to roll back instantly.

- [ ] Record groups uniting related records, i.e. Google Workspace records.

- [ ] Community-contributed templates for one-click setup.

- [ ] AI-powered instructions parser that allows to set up records by pasting the service instructions.

- [ ] Autofill with sane defaults.

- [ ] Records/group disabling.

- [ ] Mass edit, to remove/disable/enable groups and/or selected records.
